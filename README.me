# **Shippo Automation**

## **Overview**
`shippo-automation` is a Python-based automation tool designed to simplify managing shipments, generating shipping labels, and retrieving tracking information using the Shippo API. It handles bulk shipment data, provides CSV-based workflows for input and output, and generates consolidated PDFs for shipping labels.

## **Features**
- Import shipment details from an input CSV file.
- Bulk-create shipments using the Shippo API.
- Generate shipping labels and download them as individual PDFs.
- Merge all shipping labels into a single bulk PDF for easy printing.
- Export tracking details (e.g., tracking number, carrier, price) to an output CSV.
- Flexible configuration for parcel dimensions and units (e.g., `cm`, `in`).
